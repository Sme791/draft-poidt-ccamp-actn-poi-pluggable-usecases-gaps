2.  Introduction

   Packet traffic has been transferred over optical networks for many
   years blending the benefits of optical transmission and switching
   with packet switching.  Optical systems have been separated from
   packet systems, both of which have had specific dedicated devices.
   In many existing network deployments, the packet and the optical
   networks are engineered, operated and controlled independently.  The
   operation of these packet and optical networks is often siloed which
   results in non-optimal and inefficient networking.  Both packet and
   optical systems have had relatively independent evolution.  Optical
   systems have been developed with increasing capacity especially with
   the emergence of coherent optical techniques.

   Optical component design has continued to improve density to the
   point where a whole coherent optical terminal system that use to
   require many circuit packs can now fit onto a single small form
   factor "coherent plug".  Placing coherent plugs in a device with
   packet functions can reduce network cost, power consumption and
   footprint as well as improve data transfer rates, reduce latency and
   expand capacity (note that in some cases, other engineering and
   deployment considerations still lead to separate packet and optical
   solutions).

   Optical transmission/switching is analogue and requires complex and
   holistic control.  Consequently, coordination of control of the
   coherent plugs (in a device with packet functions) with the control
   of the rest of the optical network is highly desirable as this best
   enables robust network functionality and simplifies network
   operations.

   The combination of these above trends along with the desire to select
   best in breed components has led to the emergence of open optical
   plugs that offer a standard bus for traffic and that use CMIS
   [OIF-CMIS], extended with Coherent CMIS, between coherent pluggables
   and host device.  These plugs are such that a plug from vendor X can
   be installed in vendor Y's device with packet functions etc.

   An architecture analysis has been carried out by the MANTRA sub-group
   in the OOPT / TIP group (Open Optical & Packet Transport / Telecom
   Infra Project)
   [MANTRA-whitepaper-IPoWDM-convergent-SDN-architecture].

   This document provides guidellines for control and management of
   packet over optical converged networks and it is divided into
   following sections:

   *  Section 3 Packet over optical converged network context

   *  Section 4 Network Scenarios

   *  Section 5 Use cases for the control and management of Packet over
      Optical Converged Networks

   *  Section 5 Gap analysis

3.  Packet over Optical Converged Network Context

   A packet over optical network represents an efficient paradigm that
   harnesses the power of both packet-switching and optical
   technologies.  In this approach, the overlay IP or MPLS packets are
   transmitted through an underlying optical network.  The fusion of
   packet and optical networks offer a host of advantages, including
   accelerated data transfer rates, diminished latency, and expanded
   network capacity.

   In general, two deployment models can be used to deploy the packet
   over optical networks:

   *  Traditional architecture deployment model

   *  Deployment model with coherent pluggables

3.1.  Traditional Architecture Deployment Model

   The traditional architecture involves separation of the packet
   network from the optical network as shown in Figure 1.  In
   traditional approach, the packet layer responsible for routing and
   forwarding is decoupled from the underlying optical transport layer.
   This approach offers several benefits, including the ability to scale
   each layer independently, optimize resource utilization, and simplify
   network management through centralized software control.

   Disaggregation enables network operators to choose best-of-breed
   components for each layer, fostering innovation and competition in
   the networking industry.  However, implementing and managing a
   disaggregated network also comes with challenges related to
   interoperability, integration, and maintaining end-to-end performance
   across the various layers.

                                   Model

3.2.  Deployment Model with Coherent Pluggables

   The second approach is to take advantage of the small implementation
   footprint of the xPonder functions and to deploy these functions on a
   single small form factor plug (aka Coherent pluggables) and then
   place plugs directly into the packet devices as shown in Figure 2(A).
   Placing this small form factor pluggable in a device with packet
   functions can reduce network cost, power consumption and footprint
   (when these benefits are not outweighed by other engineering
   considerations).  Depending on the application, distance between
   packet devices, quality of fibers and so on it might be that there is
   no need for a ROADM network, i.e., direct connectivity between packet
   devices via plugs is possible.

   By incorporating coherent plugs into routers, network operators can
   achieve higher data rates, greater spectral efficiency, and improved
   tolerance to optical impairments.  This is especially valuable in
   scenarios where traditional electronic signaling might encounter
   limitations.  Coherent plugs enable routers to leverage advanced
   modulation schemes, digital signal processing, and error correction
   techniques, enhancing their ability to handle complex optical
   signals.

   One of the key advantages of using coherent plugs in routers is the
   potential to bridge the gap between long-haul and metro networks,
   providing a seamless and efficient transition of data across various
   network segments.  This technology can contribute to the evolution of
   high-speed data centers, interconnection between data centers, and
   the overall growth of data-intensive applications.

   as noted above, for some use-cases when the distance between packet
   devices is short and optical power of pluggables are enough, the
   photonics devices might not be needed as shown in Figure 2(B).

   where the optical network contains both coherent pluggables and
   xPonders as shown in Figure 3.

4.  Network Scenarios

   This section provides a set of packet over optical network scenarios,
   starting with the most common ones.

4.1.  Scenario A - High capacity point to point connection over
      dedicated direct fiber

   As depicted in Figure 4, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using
   dedicated fiber.

   Note that there is no amplification and no protection in this
   scenario.

4.2.  Scenario B- High capacity point to point over shared fiber

   This scenario extends Figure 4 by making more efficient use of the
   deployed fiber infrastructure.

   As shown in Figure 5, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using a
   physical optical network with DWDM filters and amplifiers.  Several
   point-to-point connections can be multiplexed from the same packet
   devices.

   Note that there is no protection in this scenario.

4.3.  Scenario 3 - High capacity point to point over metro-regional
      shared meshed network

   This scenario extends Figure 5 by making more flexible use of the
   fiber network infrastructure.

   As shown in Figure 6, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a metro/regional network (e.g., up to 500 km).
   The metro/regional network contains DWDM filters, amplifiers and
   optical switching.

   Note that there is no resilience in this scenario.  (CHECK AS
   RESTORATION COULD BE A CHOICE)

4.4.  Sceanrio D- High capacity point to point optical connection
      between plug and xPonder

   This scenario, shown in Figure 7and extends network topologies
   Figure 4 to Figure 6 and covers a corner case, where one end of an
   optical service is terminated on a plug and the other end is
   terminated on a traditional xPonder (transponder or muxponder) with
   grey optics to a packet device.  This scenario is encountered when
   one of the packet device does not support coherent plugables.

4.5.  Topo6 - Other Network scenarios.

   *  Network topology with shared switched fiber network with
      regenerators: This is extension of topology Topo-3 Figure 6 when
      the photonic network has regenerator.

   *  Asymmetric interconnect Network topology where the protection open
      at one end but both protection legs are terminated on separate
      xPonder or coherent pluggables.

   *  IP Lag Network topology where the IP link between two packet
      devices are provided by multiple coherent plugs

   *  Practical network deployments which includes the mix of many
      network topologies explained above.

5.  Operators' Use cases

   This section provides a set of packet over optical general use cases
   which are applicable to any network topologies in Section 4.  These
   use cases are presented following current operators’ priorities order
   and several of them were already mentioned in IETF118 ccamp meeting
   back in November [draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable-02].

   In general those use cases are the same: - for a traditional packet
   over optical integration based on grey interfaces in the IP routers
   and use of transponders/muxponders in the optical domain - For a
   packet over optical integration considering coherent WDM pluggables
   in the IP routers over a media channel/Network Media channel in the
   optical domain The mention ‘valid for both’ has been added in the
   name of each use case else ‘valid for coherent pluggable’ when the
   use case is specific to the coherent pluggable approach.

5.1.  1.  End-to-end multi-layer visibility and management (valid for
      both)

5.1.1.  a.  End-to-end multi-layer network and service topology
        discovery

   Target is to have a full end-to-end multi-layer view from all the
   layers and their dependencies: service layer (e.g.  L3VPN/L2VPN),
   transport layer (RSVP-TE, SR-TE), IP layer (IGP), Ethernet layer, OTN
   L1 layer (optional), DWDM L0 layer, OMS, OTS and fibre.  The above
   discovery includes inventory discovery by each controller and
   exposure to the MDSC of the required information for a complete end-
   to-end multi-layer view of the network

5.1.2.  b.  End-to-end multi-layer event/fault management (valid for
        both)

   Target is to have a full end-to-end multi-layer correlation of events
   at different layers and domains (e.g. operational-status changes
   reported at OTS/OMS/OCh/ODUk (optional), IP link level, LSP level,
   L3VPN/L2VPN level etc.) so that final root cause can be quickly
   identified and fixed (e.g. fibre cut vs coherent pluggable failure)

5.1.3.  c.  End-to-end multi-layer performance management (valid for
        both)

   Target is to have the possibility to analyse through performance
   monitoring of the different layers mentioned above and be able, in
   case of end-to-end L2VPN/L3VPN service degradation, to identify the
   root cause of the degradation.  For scaling purposes the target
   should be upon service fulfilment phase to set up the right TCAs
   associated to each layer that can allow to meet the L2VPN/L3VPN
   service SLA (e.g. latency, jitter, BW, etc.)

5.2.  2.  Inter-domain link validation (valid for coherent pluggable)

   As described in [draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-pluggable-02] even if the
   patch cord to connect coherent pluggables in the routers and optical
   nodes (add/drop filter of the ROADM) need to be done manually, these
   connections are prone to human mistakes.  It would be highly
   beneficial for operators to have a mean to check/discover that the
   right pluggables have been connected to the right ROADM filter ports

5.3.  3.  End-to-end L3VPN/L2VPN service multi-layer provisioning with
      SLA constraints (TE constraints) (valid for both)

   This use case is described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] for the SR-TE case which
   is relevant as target use case for operators.  If new connectivity is
   required between the routers and at optical level then full
   automation could be achieved.  However considering PMO (Present Mode
   of Operation) in most operators, before an optical path is setup
   either between two native transponders or between two coherent
   pluggables in routers, a detailed optical planning and validation is
   always required.  So, the automation of this use case is considered
   more for future mode of operations (FMO) and has not the same
   priority as the previous two use cases

5.4.  4.  Multi-layer protection with optical restoration support (valid
      for both but here focusing on the coherent pluggable)

   This use case has not the same priority as the previous ones as
   protection in multi-layer Core/Backhaul networks is usually
   implemented at IP layer (e.g.  FRR with RSVP-TE, TI-LFA with SR and
   SR policies in SR-TE) to avoid proven protection races.
