2.  Introduction

   Packet traffic has been transferred over optical networks for many
   years blending the benefits of optical transmission and switching
   with packet switching.  Optical systems have been separated from
   packet systems, both of which have had specific dedicated devices.
   In many existing network deployments, the packet and the optical
   networks are engineered, operated and controlled independently.  The
   operation of these packet and optical networks is often siloed which
   results in non-optimal and inefficient networking.  Both packet and
   optical systems have had relatively independent evolution.  Optical
   systems have been developed with increasing capacity especially with
   the emergence of coherent optical techniques.

   Optical component design has continued to improve density to the
   point where a whole coherent optical terminal system that use to
   require many circuit packs can now fit onto a single small form
   factor "coherent plug".  Placing coherent plugs in a device with
   packet functions can reduce network cost, power consumption and
   footprint as well as improve data transfer rates, reduce latency and
   expand capacity (note that in some cases, other engineering and
   deployment considerations still lead to separate packet and optical
   solutions).

   Optical transmission/switching is analogue and requires complex and
   holistic control.  Consequently, coordination of control of the
   coherent plugs (in a device with packet functions) with the control
   of the rest of the optical network is highly desirable as this best
   enables robust network functionality and simplifies network
   operations.

   The combination of these above trends along with the desire to select
   best in breed components has led to the emergence of open optical
   plugs that offer a standard bus for traffic and that use CMIS
   [OIF-CMIS], extended with Coherent CMIS, between coherent pluggables
   and host device.  These plugs are such that a plug from vendor X can
   be installed in vendor Y's device with packet functions etc.

   An architecture analysis has been carried out by the MANTRA sub-group
   in the OOPT / TIP group (Open Optical & Packet Transport / Telecom
   Infra Project)
   [MANTRA-whitepaper-IPoWDM-convergent-SDN-architecture].

   This document provides guidellines for control and management of
   packet over optical converged networks and it is divided into
   following sections:

   *  Section 3 Packet over optical converged network context

   *  Section 4 Network Scenarios

   *  Section 5 Use cases for the control and management of Packet over
      Optical Converged Networks

   *  Section 5 Gap analysis

3.  Packet over Optical Converged Network Context

   A packet over optical network represents an efficient paradigm that
   harnesses the power of both packet-switching and optical
   technologies.  In this approach, the overlay IP or MPLS packets are
   transmitted through an underlying optical network.  The fusion of
   packet and optical networks offer a host of advantages, including
   accelerated data transfer rates, diminished latency, and expanded
   network capacity.

   In general, two deployment models can be used to deploy the packet
   over optical networks:

   *  Traditional architecture deployment model

   *  Deployment model with coherent pluggables

3.1.  Traditional Architecture Deployment Model

   The traditional architecture involves separation of the packet
   network from the optical network as shown in Figure 1.  In
   traditional approach, the packet layer responsible for routing and
   forwarding is decoupled from the underlying optical transport layer.
   This approach offers several benefits, including the ability to scale
   each layer independently, optimize resource utilization, and simplify
   network management through centralized software control.

   Disaggregation enables network operators to choose best-of-breed
   components for each layer, fostering innovation and competition in
   the networking industry.  However, implementing and managing a
   disaggregated network also comes with challenges related to
   interoperability, integration, and maintaining end-to-end performance
   across the various layers.

                                   Model

3.2.  Deployment Model with Coherent Pluggables

   The second approach is to take advantage of the small implementation
   footprint of the xPonder functions and to deploy these functions on a
   single small form factor plug (aka Coherent pluggables) and then
   place plugs directly into the packet devices as shown in Figure 2(A).
   Placing this small form factor pluggable in a device with packet
   functions can reduce network cost, power consumption and footprint
   (when these benefits are not outweighed by other engineering
   considerations).  Depending on the application, distance between
   packet devices, quality of fibers and so on it might be that there is
   no need for a ROADM network, i.e., direct connectivity between packet
   devices via plugs is possible.

   By incorporating coherent plugs into routers, network operators can
   achieve higher data rates, greater spectral efficiency, and improved
   tolerance to optical impairments.  This is especially valuable in
   scenarios where traditional electronic signaling might encounter
   limitations.  Coherent plugs enable routers to leverage advanced
   modulation schemes, digital signal processing, and error correction
   techniques, enhancing their ability to handle complex optical
   signals.

   One of the key advantages of using coherent plugs in routers is the
   potential to bridge the gap between long-haul and metro networks,
   providing a seamless and efficient transition of data across various
   network segments.  This technology can contribute to the evolution of
   high-speed data centers, interconnection between data centers, and
   the overall growth of data-intensive applications.

   as noted above, for some use-cases when the distance between packet
   devices is short and optical power of pluggables are enough, the
   photonics devices might not be needed as shown in Figure 2(B).

   In reality, the operators' packet over optical networks will most
   likely be a combination of networks shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2
   where the optical network contains both coherent pluggables and
   xPonders as shown in Figure 3.

4.  Network Scenarios

   This section provides a set of packet over optical network scenarios,
   starting with the most common ones.

4.1.  Scenario A - High capacity point to point connection over
      dedicated direct fiber

   As depicted in Figure 4, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using
   dedicated fiber.

   Note that there is no amplification and no protection in this
   scenario.

4.2.  Scenario B- High capacity point to point over shared fiber

   This scenario extends Figure 4 by making more efficient use of the
   deployed fiber infrastructure.

   As shown in Figure 5, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using a
   physical optical network with DWDM filters and amplifiers.  Several
   point-to-point connections can be multiplexed from the same packet
   devices.

   Note that there is no protection in this scenario.

4.3.  Scenario 3 - High capacity point to point over metro-regional
      shared meshed network

   This scenario extends Figure 5 by making more flexible use of the
   fiber network infrastructure.

   As shown in Figure 6, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a metro/regional network (e.g., up to 500 km).
   The metro/regional network contains DWDM filters, amplifiers and
   optical switching.

   Note that there is no resilience in this scenario.  (CHECK AS
   RESTORATION COULD BE A CHOICE)

4.4.  Sceanrio D- High capacity point to point optical connection
      between plug and xPonder

   This scenario, shown in Figure 7and extends network topologies
   Figure 4 to Figure 6 and covers a corner case, where one end of an
   optical service is terminated on a plug and the other end is
   terminated on a traditional xPonder (transponder or muxponder) with
   grey optics to a packet device.  This scenario is encountered when
   one of the packet device does not support coherent plugables.

4.5.  Topo6 - Other Network scenarios.

   *  Network topology with shared switched fiber network with
      regenerators: This is extension of topology Topo-3 Figure 6 when
      the photonic network has regenerator.

   *  Asymmetric interconnect Network topology where the protection open
      at one end but both protection legs are terminated on separate
      xPonder or coherent pluggables.

   *  IP Lag Network topology where the IP link between two packet
      devices are provided by multiple coherent plugs

   *  Practical network deployments which includes the mix of many
      network topologies explained above.
